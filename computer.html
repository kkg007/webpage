        intentionally writes a virus program with a motive to damage data or programs residing in a computer. 
Some virus attaches itself to a file and lies dormant.But when a certain date or event occurs, it gets triggered and become active.
One such notorious virus is called 

     <u><b><font color= "#800000">

            Flame is a sophisticated type of malware — short for malicious software — capable of infecting myriad computer networks for the purpose of gathering sensitive data. Once a network is infected by Flame, the virus can relay back massive amounts of information through a computer’s facilities.
